/**
 * Abstract scene model for 3-d visualizations of connection-maps.
 *
 * Note: This abstract model is kept simple. For more sophisticated models,
 * further implementations could be added later.
 *
 * Basically, the visualization pipeline will be realized as follows: In a first
 * step, feature-nets (which are modelled as geo-objects here) wil be mapped to
 * an abstract scene, e.g. a
 * <tt>WvizVirtualConnectionMapScene</tt>. This abstract ("virtual") scene does
 * not know anything about its final realization (X3D, KML, etc.). In a second
 * transformation step, this abstract scene will be mapped to the desired target
 * environment, e.g. X3D. Inside 52N Triturus WorldViz, these mappers are
 * implemented as explicite entities ("transformation processes" as Java
 * objects).
