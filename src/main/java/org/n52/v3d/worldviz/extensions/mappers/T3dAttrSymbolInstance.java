/**
 * This is an extension of {@link T3dSymbolInstance} that contains an additional
 * list of attributeValuePairs. This is useful if you want to map different
 * attributes of an {@link VgAttrFeature} to different visual components of a
 * symbol in a scene description. You can then add all the used attributes names
 * and values to the symbol instance.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Example: You want to map the population of a country to the radius of a
 * sphere and in addition want to map the CO2-emission of that country to the
 * color of the sphere. In the final scene you may need to link the visual
 * components (radius and color) to the attribute data (population and
 * CO2-emission). In that case, you may use this class to attach the attribute
 * data to the symbolInstance for later access.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * In Addition, three scale parameter are defined. For each coordinate axes of
 * the scene there is one scale parameter. So if you only change the
 * corresponding scale of the x-axis, then the symbol only gets scaled in that
 * direction. This way, it is possible to have more control of the scale of a
 * symbol in the final scene and for instance map another attribute to the
 * height(y-axis in the scene) of the symbol. Note that
 * {@link #setScale(double)} of the parent class {@link T3dSymbolInstance} sets
 * an overall scale parameter that affects all three coordinate axes in the same
 * extent.
