Thus, WorldViz allows to generate concrete scene descriptions\r\n(e.g., a X3D document) from geo-data, thereby keeping the \"cartographic\" mapping process \r\nconfigurable. \r\n\r\nWorldViz is based on the existing 52°North Triturus module and shall offer various \r\nworld visualizations, e.g. globes (limited to world-scale), potato-like globe \r\ndeformations depending on thematic data, feature-space scenes (\"attribute space\"), \r\nvisualization of geo-object relations (connection maps in 3-d space) as well as planar \r\nmap-projections in 3-d space. WorldViz will offer scene export facilities for various\r\nconcrete scene descriptions (presumably for X3D, X3DOM, KML). \r\n\r\nThe framework will be used to set-up the experiental space ENE (\"Erlebnisraum\r\nNachhaltige Entwicklung\") at Bochum University of Applied Science. Both the ENE and\r\nthis framework are open to anyone who is interested. You are very welcome to participate\r\nor to bring in innovative visualization ideas! \r\n\r\n## Basic functionality:\r\n* Readers for thematic world data (XML-based ENE data) and shape geometries\r\n* Simple scene export (e.g., X3D/X3DOM scene descriptions)\r\n* Generation of globe representations at world-scale\r\n* ... \r\n\r\n## Characteristics\r\n* Development platform: Java (Windows and Linux/Unix)\r\n* Visualization pipeline (filter, mapper, renderer) as reference model\r\n* Abstraction of concrete (geo-)datasources and scene description environments through interfaces\r\n\r\n## Development goals\r\nThe community's vision is to establish a creative surrounding, which allows efficient and sustainable \r\ndevelopment of innovative software solutions in the context of 3d geovisualization at world scale.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nSince this is a Maven project, the typical Maven installation tasks can be executed to build this project.\r\nTo compile the Triturus WorldViz library, simply run Maven's 'package' task.\r\n\r\nTo use the Triturus WorldViz library, just add the WorldViz JAR file to your Java project.\r\n\r\nNote that Triturus WorldViz requires the 52°North Triturus library (JAR) which is already included as a dependency in the pom.xml-file.\r\n\r\n## License information\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the \r\nApache License version 2.0.\r\n\r\nFor further information please refer to 'LICENSE'-file\r\n\r\n## Additional documents and links\r\nThis sections lists documents that lead to a deeper understanding of the Triturus library and give \r\nadditional information.\r\n\r\n* White Paper of Triturus: http://52north.org/images/stories/52n/communities/3D/triturus%20white%20paper.pdf \r\n* 52°North 3D Community Wiki: https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/V3d/ \r\n* Triturus Wiki: https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/V3d/Triturus \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nYou are interested in contributing to the 52°North Triturus or  WorldViz  and you want to pull your\r\nchanges to the 52°North repository to make it available to all?\r\n\r\nIn that case we need your official permission and for this purpose we have a so called contributors \r\nlicense agreement (CLA) in place.
