			Time lapse sequences of photographs taken by Ron Garan
fragileoasis.org/âbloggernauts/âAstro_Ron and the crew of expedition
28 &amp; 29 onboard the International Space Station from August to October,
2011, who to my knowledge shot these pictures at an altitude of around
350 km with a high ISO HD Camera developed by NHK Japan,
nicknamed the SS-HDTV camera. All credit goes to them.
I intend to upload a FullHD-version presently.

HD, refurbished, smoothed, retimed, denoised, deflickered, cut, etc.
All in all I tried to keep the looks of the material as original as possible,
avoided adjusting the colors and the like, since in my opinion the original
footage itself already has an almost surreal and aestethical visual nature.
