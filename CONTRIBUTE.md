## Contributor License Agreement

52°North requires all contributors to sign a contributors license agreement (CLA). This is not scary but essential for open source projects to live beyond projects and individual contributions.

Find all information on our licensing page at <http://52north.org/about/licensing/> and our CLA FAQ at <http://52north.org/about/licensing/cla-guidelines>.

## Adding new features

This section includes advice on how to build new features for the project & what kind of process it includes. 

* Before you start working on a new feature, create a new issue and start a discussion on the mailing list.
* Also you might want to check the Trello Board [connection maps](https://trello.com/b/890k2iEM/connection-maps), since we use this board to maintain task lists. (The connection map part has been created during the [Google Summer of Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015) project and will be continued in the future.)
* We follow the fork & pull development model: <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>

Don’t get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the
maintainers is around 4 days.

# Bug triage

You can help report bugs by filing them here: <https://github.com/52North/worldviz/issues>

* Don't forget to check the existing ones first and take a look at the mailing list guidelines - going through these steps makes it likely that you can fix the bug yourself: <http://52north.org/resources/mailing-list-and-forums/mailinglist-guidelines>
* Look at existing bugs and help us understand if the bug is reproducible. Is it reproducible in other environments (browsers)? What are the steps to reproduce? 


# Documentation

All documentation is either in README.md file or, in future will be added [to the 52°North 3D wiki](https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/V3d/WebHome), and a critical read as well as feedback and documentation extensions are always welcome.


* If you have further questions, contact Benno: [@BennoSchmidt](https://github.com/BennoSchmidt), b.schmidt@52north.org
